Main Point (3-5 bullets or short paragraphs)
↓
Key Takeaway
↓
Engagement Question

Total: 150-300 words
```

**Example:**
```
I spent a week using only AI-powered tools. Here's what I learned about the future of work.

Context: As part of a personal experiment, I switched to Atlas browser, Notion AI, and several other AI tools for all my work.

Key observations:

→ Speed matters more than I thought. I saved ~2 hours per week just from faster searching and organization.

→ The privacy tradeoff is real. Every AI tool wanted comprehensive access to my data to work effectively.

→ AI suggestions were 70% helpful, 30% noise. The challenge is filtering what's actually useful.

The lesson: AI tools will make us more productive. But we need to be intentional about which ones we adopt and what we're willing to trade.

Question for you: What AI tools have you found genuinely useful in your work?
```

## Hook Creation (CRITICAL)

### The First 2 Lines

**Rule: First 2 lines determine everything**

LinkedIn truncates after ~120 characters. Users decide in those first 2 lines whether to click "see more."

**Hook Formula 1: Bold Statement**
```
[Contrarian or surprising statement]
[Why it matters]

Examples:
- "AI browsers aren't the future. They're the present. And we're not ready."
- "I spent 7 days with Atlas browser. Here's what every tech professional needs to know."
- "The best new browser I tried this year has a serious privacy problem."
```

**Hook Formula 2: Personal Story**
```
[Specific moment or realization]
[Hint at the lesson]

Examples:
- "At 2 AM, I realized my browser knew more about me than my colleagues do."
- "Last week I switched browsers. It changed how I think about AI."
- "I've been a Chrome loyalist for 10 years. Atlas made me question that."
```

**Hook Formula 3: Question**
```
[Thought-provoking question]
[Why you're asking]

Examples:
- "Would you let AI track your every digital move if it made you 30% more productive?"
- "What if the tools making us more efficient are also making us more vulnerable?"
- "When does convenience become a security risk?"
```

**Hook Formula 4: Numbers/Data**
```
[Surprising statistic or result]
[What this means]

Examples:
- "40% faster page loads. 60% more RAM usage. 100% of my browsing history logged."
- "After testing 5 AI browsers, only 1 passed my security check."
- "Day 1: Excited. Day 3: Impressed. Day 7: Concerned."
```

**Hook Requirements:**
```
✅ 120 characters or less (2 lines on mobile)
✅ Creates curiosity or provides value signal
✅ Professional tone
✅ No clickbait
✅ Sets up the main content

❌ Generic opening
❌ Burying the lede
❌ Too much setup
❌ Vague hook
```

## Professional Voice

### Tone Balance

**The LinkedIn Voice:**
```
Professional BUT Human
Authoritative BUT Not Arrogant
Personal BUT Not Oversharing
Confident BUT Not Boastful
Conversational BUT Not Too Casual
```

**Language Guidelines:**

**DO:**
```
✅ Share learnings from experience
✅ Admit mistakes and growth
✅ Ask for others' perspectives
✅ Use industry terminology appropriately
✅ Write in first person
✅ Be specific and concrete
✅ Show thought process
```

**DON'T:**
```
❌ Use excessive corporate jargon
❌ Be overly promotional
❌ Share unrelated personal drama
❌ Write in third person about yourself
❌ Use too many emojis (max 2-3 per post)
❌ Be overly casual
❌ Humble-brag
```

**Tone Examples:**
```
❌ Too Corporate:
"Leveraging synergies to optimize deliverables"

❌ Too Casual:
"OMG this browser is lit 🔥🔥🔥"

✅ Just Right:
"After testing Atlas for a week, here's what stood out"

---

❌ Too Boastful:
"I'm an expert in browser technology"

❌ Too Humble:
"I don't know much, but..."

✅ Just Right:
"As someone who's tested 20+ browsers over the years"

---

❌ Too Salesy:
"This amazing tool will transform your life!"

❌ Too Negative:
"This tool is garbage"

✅ Just Right:
"Atlas has potential, but significant privacy concerns"
```

## Content Structure

## Content to Avoid

### Low-Engagement Content

**Generic Motivation:**
```
❌ "Happy Monday!"
❌ "Believe in yourself!"
❌ Generic inspirational quotes

These rarely get engagement from professionals.
```

**Obvious Self-Promotion:**
```
❌ "Check out our new product!"
❌ "We're hiring! Apply now!"
❌ Pure company PR

Better: Wrap in story or lesson
```

**Controversial for Controversy:**
```
❌ Political hot takes
❌ Divisive social issues
❌ Personal attacks
❌ Drama

This isn't Twitter. Stay professional.
```

**Oversharing:**
```
❌ Very personal family details
❌ Health issues (unless relevant)
❌ Relationship drama
❌ Financial struggles (unless teaching moment)

Keep it professionally relevant.
```
